# EPFL Master Thesis (2021)
## Modulatory Effects in Neurostimulation from Remote Cortical Areas for Neuroprosthetic Control

---

This github repo contains the functions that I wrote during my the course of my master thesis research. 

These functions require the following libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- GPy
- Tdt
- Scipy
- SKLearn
- Itertools
- Collections

---
There are currently 3 python files that contains functions:
- __GP_functions.py:__ contains functions used for Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization
- __multi_unit_functions.py:__ contains functions used for threshold crossing and loading the data
- __multi_unit_plotting_functions.py:__ contains functions used for spatial plotting of results. 

The data that these functions use is proprietary to the lab, and therefore I cannot share it.
